    <p>Hello my name is <strong>Carter McGhinnis</strong>, and my favorite place to walk to is infront of <em>Talley</em> student union.  I take this walk on my way to class everyday.  I find this walk very peaceful as I like to see the people enjoying their time outside. I also enjoy experiencing the nature this <strong>beautiful</strong> campus has to offer! </p>
